## FaaS Scheduling Benchmark

This benchmark suite is designed for evaluating the scheduler in a Function-as-a-Service platform. It consists of functions from various application domains so as to simulate the mixed workload in production.

### Prerequisite

If you want to deploy and run the functions, you need to ...

1. ... have an [Alibaba Cloud](https://us.alibabacloud.com/) account because the functions are implemented for [Function Compute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/function-compute).

2. ... know how to use [`fun` CLI](https://github.com/alibaba/funcraft) tool. If not, you could check out this [Get Started](https://github.com/alibaba/funcraft/blob/master/docs/usage/getting_started.md) guide.


### Repo Structure

Five applications, each with two functions. You could follow the README.md in each application directory.

### Portability

The benchmark suite only supports Function Compute. To port it to other FaaS platforms, you have to change the way how arguments are passed into the function and how they are deployed.
